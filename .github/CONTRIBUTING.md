# Contributing to Latt

#### Introduction

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! 🎉💪

The following is a set of guidelines (not rules) for contributing to Latt. This project follows the [all-contributors](https://github.com/kentcdodds/all-contributors) specification. Feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

#### Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by [our Code of Conduct](https://github.com/latt-dev/latt-api/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

#### Your first contribution

There are many ways to contribute:

- improving the documentation
- submitting bug reports
- submitting feature requests
- writing new code
- writing unit tests for existing code

Unsure where to begin contributing to Latt? You can start by diving into the [issue tracker](https://github.com/latt-dev/latt-api/issues). Look through the `good first issue` (issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two) and `help wanted` (issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues) labels specifically.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this _free_ series [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

#### Getting Started

Please, don't use the issue tracker for support questions and other non-functional communication!

Please, use [issue template](https://github.com/latt-dev/latt-api/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md) to create a detailed report on a problem (or description for a feature/enhancement suggestion), and make sure you're following the [pull request template](https://github.com/latt-dev/latt-api/blob/master/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) when submitting a new PR.

#### Code Style

Please, be sure you follow the common [ESLint code style config](https://github.com/latt-dev/latt-api/blob/master/.eslintrc.js) while working with the project code. To check correspondence of current code state to common rules you can use `npm run lint` command.

Code formatting is covered by [prettier](https://github.com/latt-dev/latt-api/blob/master/.prettierrc). To format project files run `npm run format`, and feel free to set up on-save formatting in your editor/IDE of choice.

#### Review Process

The repository maintainer(s) looks at Pull Requests (as well as issues submitted) on a regular basis. After feedback has been given you're expected to provide a response within three weeks. After three weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
